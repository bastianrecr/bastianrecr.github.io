# Portfolio Website – Sebastian Regules

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This site is more than just another Codecademy project — it's my live, evolving space to showcase the skills I'm building as I pursue my path as a Full-Stack Web Developer.

## 🚀 About the Project

This portfolio was designed and built using:

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (following the [BEM methodology](http://getbem.com/))
- **JavaScript (vanilla)**

It highlights projects I've developed throughout my learning journey, grouped by platform (e.g., Codecademy, Frontend Mentor), with the goal of keeping the interface clean, responsive, and modular.

## 📁 Features

- Semantic HTML5 structure
- Fully responsive layout
- Skill section with SVG icons
- Projects organized by learning platform
- Accordion-style interaction using accessible JS
- BEM-based CSS architecture

## 🛠️ Future Improvements

This is an active project I plan to continue evolving as I grow as a developer. Upcoming steps include:

- ✨ **Modularizing the JavaScript** using reusable, component-based logic
- 🔄 **Refactoring into React + Vite** for better scalability and structure
- 🎠 **Implementing a project carousel** to display content dynamically without overloading page height
- 📁 Breaking the site into logical components and folders for maintainability
- 🌐 Adding multi-language support (eventually Spanish and English)
